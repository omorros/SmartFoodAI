# SmartFood AI  
### Intelligent Food Management System to Reduce Household Food Waste  
*(Work in Progress)*

---

## Overview  
SmartFood AI is an ongoing project that uses Artificial Intelligence to help users manage household food inventory and reduce waste.  
The system combines **Computer Vision**, **OCR**, and **Machine Learning** to recognize grocery items, scan receipts or labels, and predict expiry dates.  
All data is stored locally in **SQLite**, allowing for item tracking and smart recipe or shopping suggestions.

---

## Core Features (Planned & In Development)
- Image recognition of grocery items using CNN (EfficientNet / MobileNet).  
- OCR receipt and label scanning (pytesseract + OpenCV).  
- Expiry date prediction using supervised ML models.  
- Inventory management with automatic expiry alerts.  
- Recipe and shopping recommendations based on available items.

## Technologies  
Python · TensorFlow · Keras · scikit-learn · OpenCV · pytesseract · SQLite · Pandas  

---

## Development Roadmap  
- Phase 1: Dataset setup and CNN model training  
- Phase 2: OCR integration and database design  
- Phase 3: Expiry prediction model  
- Phase 4: Recommender system and alerts  
- Phase 5: UI / API integration (future)

---

## Future Improvements  
- Frontend dashboard (React / Streamlit)  
- REST API deployment (Flask / FastAPI)  
- Voice input support  
- Cloud sync and IoT integration
